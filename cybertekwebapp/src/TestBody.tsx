      <strong>Hi Nishil I am Prasobh</strong> It was easy to spot her. All you
      needed to do was look at her socks. They were never a matching pair. One
      would be green while the other would be blue. One would reach her knee
      while the other barely touched her ankle. Every other part of her was
      perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of rebellion.
      Breastfeeding is good for babies and moms. Infants that are breastfed get
      antibodies from their mothers against common illnesses. Breastfed babies
      have less chance of being obese as an adult. Breastfeeding a baby lets the
      infant-mother pair bond in a very unique way. Mother’s who breastfeed
      lower their chances of developing breast cancer. Usually, mothers who
      breastfeed lose their pregnancy weight more quickly and easily. The
      benefits of breastfeeding are numerous. At that moment, she realized that
      she had created her current life. It wasn't the life she wanted, but she
      took responsibility for how it currently stood. Something clicked and she
      saw that every choice she made to this point in her life had led to where
      her life stood at this very moment even if she knew this wasn't where she
      wanted to be. She determined to choose to change it. He walked down the
      steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in
      the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible. Bounding down the
      steps, he heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic. There
      was nobody there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed neatly on
      the steps he had just come down. Had he past them without seeing them? It
      didn't seem possible. He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep
      chill filled his body. Many people say that life isn't like a bed of
      roses. I beg to differ. I think that life is quite like a bed of roses.
      Just like life, a bed of roses looks pretty on the outside, but when
      you're in it, you find that it is nothing but thorns and pain. I myself
      have been pricked quite badly. I don’t like cats and they don’t like me. I
      used to be allergic to them and I would get stuffed up and have hives.
      That doesn’t seem to happen anymore. But I still don’t like them. I lived
      with 3 cats that were not good at peeing in the litter box. They seemed to
      find something important to me and pee on it. Most of the time they peed
      on photographs or papers that would be ruined. Cats also bring fleas into
      the house. There is nothing worse than having to flea dip cats and also
      flea bomb a home. That is why I don’t like cats. It was a question of
      which of the two she preferred. On the one hand, the choice seemed simple.
      The more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most. It
      was the easy choice. The safe choice. But she wasn't sure she actually
      preferred it. The song came from the bathroom belting over the sound of
      the shower's running water. It was the same way each day began since he
      could remember. It listened intently and concluded that the singing today
      was as terrible as it had ever been. Things aren't going well at all with
      mom today. She is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time. I
      sure hope that things get better soon. She needed glasses. It wasn't that
      she couldn't see without them, but what she could see with them. When she
      wore glasses, her eyes focused so deeply that she could see not only the
      physical but also beyond. It was like a superpower. But she needed
      glasses. The opened package of potato chips held the answer to the
      mystery. Both detectives looked at it but failed to realize it was the key
      to solve the crime. They passed by it assuming it was random trash
      ensuring that the case would never be solved. She nervously peered over
      the edge. She understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be
      beautiful, but all she felt was fear. There had always been something
      about heights that disturbed her, and now she could feel the full force of
      this unease. She reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement
      of her friends as the fear continued to build. She couldn't help but feel
      that something horrible was about to happen. They argue. While the
      argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. Yes, the
      topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done,
      it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but neither has the
      courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to
      argue. The coin hovered in the air, spinning over and over again. It
      reached its peak and began to descend. Both boys were pleading with it to
      land a certain way but the coin had already made up its mind on what it
      was going to do. Stormi is a dog. She is dark grey and has long legs. Her
      eyes are expressive and are able to let her humans know what she is
      thinking. Her tongue is long, pink, and wet. Her long legs allow her to
      sprint after other dogs, people or bunnies. She can be a good dog, but
      also very bad. Her tail wags when happy or excited and hides between her
      back legs when she is bad. Stormi is a dog I love. My pincher collar is
      snapped on. Then comes the electric zapper collar. Finally, my purple
      at-home collar is taken off and I know I’m going for a walk to the dog
      park. I’m so excited to see my friends. I hope Spike or Thunder are there
      already. They're the most fun to chase and tumble with. My human is pretty
      strict with me. I’m only allowed on the grass and not on the sidewalks. I
      think she’s afraid I’m going to jump on the other humans. I don’t
      understand why everyone else gets to jump on the benches and run wild on
      the sidewalks. They don’t listen to their humans. I know I could ignore
      mine but if I do she may zap me and it’s just not worth it. She probably
      wouldn’t let me back at the dog park if I didn’t listen to her. I just
      love the dog park. The bush began to shake. Brad couldn't see what was
      causing it to shake, but he didn't care. he had a pretty good idea about
      what was going on and what was happening. He was so confident that he
      approached the bush carefree and with a smile on his face. That all
      changed the instant he realized what was actually behind the bush.
      Twenty-five years Dana had been waiting. She tried to be patient during
      that time but she hadn't always managed to be as patient as she'd like.
      But today the opportunity had finally come. The thing she always imagined
      would make her the happiest person in the world was about to happen. She
      didn't know why at this specific time she all of a sudden felt sick
      inside. The drug seekers would come into the emergency room and scream
      about how much pain they were in. When you told them that you would start
      elevating their pain with Tylenol or Advil instead of a narcotic they
      became nasty and combative. They would start telling you what drug and
      dose they had to have to make their pain tolerable. After dealing with the
      same drug seekers several times a month it gets old. Some of the doctors
      would give in and give them a dose of morphine and send them away. Sure
      that was faster, but ethically she still couldn’t do it. Perhaps that’s
      why she had longer care times than the other doctors. I've rented a car in
      Las Vegas and have reserved a hotel in Twentynine Palms which is just
      north of Joshua Tree. We'll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave National
      Preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down. Then spend all day
      on Monday at Joshua Tree. We can decide the next morning if we want to do
      more in Joshua Tree or Mojave before we head back.
